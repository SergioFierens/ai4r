# In this example we group results from a post-training survey into 4 groups.
# The Diana algorithm is used, but you can try other algorithms by changing
# the word "Diana" by "KMeans", "AverageLinkage", or any other cluster implementation.
# The cluster API is the same, so you can play around and observe different results.
