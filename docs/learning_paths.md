# AI4R Learning Paths

AI4R offers three self-guided tracks to build your intuition for machine learning in Ruby. Start with the basics, progress to intermediate concepts, and finish with advanced topics.

1. [Beginner Track](learning_path_1_beginner.md) – *Build core intuition for AI—step by step, in Ruby.*
2. [Intermediate Track](learning_path_2_intermediate.md) – *From “I can run a model” to “I can tune, extend, and build smart stuff that actually works.”*
3. [Advanced Track](learning_path_3_advanced.md) – *Time to stop following recipes and start writing your own.*
