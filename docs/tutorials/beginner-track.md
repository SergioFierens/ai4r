## Chapter 1: Your First AI Decision 🤖

### The Challenge: Teaching a Computer to Classify

Let's start with the most fundamental question in AI: *"How do we teach a computer to make decisions?"*

Imagine you're a botanist with a collection of iris flowers. You want to teach a computer to identify the species based on measurements. This is called **classification** - one of the most common AI tasks.

### 🧪 Experiment 1: The Iris Classification Showdown

```ruby
require 'ai4r'

# Create your first AI lab
puts "🧪 Welcome to your first AI experiment!"

# Set up the benchmark arena
bench = Ai4r::Experiment::ClassifierBench.new(verbose: true)

# Add your first AI "students" (classifiers)
bench.add_classifier(:decision_tree, Ai4r::Classifiers::ID3.new, 
  friendly_name: "Logic Tree")

bench.add_classifier(:naive_bayes, Ai4r::Classifiers::NaiveBayes.new,
  friendly_name: "Probability Master")

bench.add_classifier(:zero_rule, Ai4r::Classifiers::ZeroR.new,
  friendly_name: "Simple Guesser")

# Create your training data (simplified iris dataset)
iris_data = Ai4r::Data::DataSet.new(
  data_labels: ['sepal_length', 'sepal_width', 'petal_length', 'petal_width', 'species'],
  data_items: [
    # Setosa flowers (smaller petals)
    ['small', 'wide', 'short', 'narrow', 'setosa'],
    ['small', 'wide', 'short', 'narrow', 'setosa'],
    ['small', 'medium', 'short', 'narrow', 'setosa'],
    ['small', 'wide', 'short', 'narrow', 'setosa'],
    ['small', 'wide', 'short', 'narrow', 'setosa'],
    
    # Versicolor flowers (medium petals)
    ['medium', 'medium', 'medium', 'medium', 'versicolor'],
    ['medium', 'medium', 'medium', 'medium', 'versicolor'],
    ['medium', 'narrow', 'medium', 'medium', 'versicolor'],
    ['medium', 'medium', 'medium', 'medium', 'versicolor'],
    ['medium', 'medium', 'medium', 'medium', 'versicolor'],
    
    # Virginica flowers (larger petals)
    ['large', 'medium', 'long', 'wide', 'virginica'],
    ['large', 'narrow', 'long', 'wide', 'virginica'],
    ['large', 'medium', 'long', 'wide', 'virginica'],
    ['large', 'medium', 'long', 'wide', 'virginica'],
    ['large', 'medium', 'long', 'wide', 'virginica']
  ]
)

# Let the competition begin!
results = bench.run(iris_data)

# See the results
bench.display_results(results)

# Get insights
insights = bench.generate_insights(results)
puts insights
```

### 🔍 What Just Happened?

You just witnessed three different AI approaches compete to solve the same problem:

1. **Logic Tree (ID3)**: Creates a series of yes/no questions ("Is petal length short? If yes, then...")
2. **Probability Master (Naive Bayes)**: Calculates probabilities based on past examples
3. **Simple Guesser (ZeroR)**: Always guesses the most common answer (our baseline)

**Key Insight**: The Logic Tree and Probability Master both achieved 100% accuracy, while Simple Guesser got 33.3%. This shows that AI algorithms can learn patterns that simple guessing cannot!

## Chapter 2: The Path to Intelligence 🗺️

### The Challenge: Finding Your Way

Now let's tackle another fundamental AI problem: **pathfinding**. How does a GPS find the shortest route? How does a robot navigate around obstacles?

### 🧪 Experiment 2: The Great Maze Race

```ruby
require 'ai4r'

# Create a simple maze (0 = path, 1 = wall)
maze = [
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]

puts "🗺️  Welcome to the Great Maze Race!"
puts "Our maze:"
maze.each { |row| puts row.map { |cell| cell == 1 ? '██' : '  ' }.join }

# Set up the search arena
bench = Ai4r::Experiment::SearchBench.new(verbose: true)

# Add different pathfinding strategies
bench.add_algorithm(:manhattan_pathfinder, 
  Ai4r::Search::AStar.new(maze, heuristic: :manhattan),
  friendly_name: "City Driver")

bench.add_algorithm(:euclidean_pathfinder, 
  Ai4r::Search::AStar.new(maze, heuristic: :euclidean),
  friendly_name: "Crow Flyer")

# Define the pathfinding challenge
bench.add_problem(:escape_maze, {
  type: :pathfinding,
  grid: maze,
  start: [0, 0],  # Top-left corner
  goal: [4, 4]    # Bottom-right corner
}, friendly_name: "Great Escape")

# Race time!
results = bench.run

# Display the race results
bench.display_results(results)

# Show the winning path
winner = results.values.first[:escape_maze]
if winner[:success]
  puts "\n🏆 Winning path found!"
  puts "Path: #{winner[:solution].inspect}"
  puts "Steps taken: #{winner[:solution].length}"
end
```

### 🔍 What Just Happened?

You just saw two different strategies for finding paths:

1. **City Driver (Manhattan)**: Thinks in terms of city blocks (up, down, left, right)
2. **Crow Flyer (Euclidean)**: Thinks in terms of straight-line distance

**Key Insight**: Different strategies can lead to different solutions! The algorithm that "thinks" more like the actual problem often performs better.

## Chapter 3: The Art of Comparison 📊

### The Challenge: Understanding Performance

The real power of AI4R comes from comparing algorithms. Let's learn how to be an AI detective!

### 🧪 Experiment 3: The Detective's Toolkit

```ruby
require 'ai4r'

# Create multiple test scenarios
easy_maze = [
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 0],
  [0, 0, 0]
]

tricky_maze = [
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
  [1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]

# Set up comprehensive testing
bench = Ai4r::Experiment::SearchBench.new(verbose: true)

# Add multiple algorithms
bench.add_algorithm(:manhattan, Ai4r::Search::AStar.new(easy_maze, heuristic: :manhattan))
bench.add_algorithm(:euclidean, Ai4r::Search::AStar.new(easy_maze, heuristic: :euclidean))
bench.add_algorithm(:diagonal, Ai4r::Search::AStar.new(easy_maze, heuristic: :diagonal))

# Add multiple problems
bench.add_problem(:easy_escape, {
  type: :pathfinding,
  grid: easy_maze,
  start: [0, 0],
  goal: [2, 2]
})

bench.add_problem(:tricky_escape, {
  type: :pathfinding,
  grid: tricky_maze,
  start: [0, 0],
  goal: [4, 4]
})

# Run the comprehensive test
results = bench.run

# Analyze like a detective
bench.display_results(results)

# Get the full story
insights = bench.generate_insights(results)
puts insights

# Export for further analysis
bench.export_results(:csv, "my_first_ai_analysis")
puts "\n📊 Results saved to my_first_ai_analysis.csv"
```

### 🔍 Detective Skills Unlocked!

You now know how to:
- **Compare Performance**: Which algorithm is fastest? Most efficient?
- **Analyze Trade-offs**: Speed vs. accuracy, simplicity vs. power
- **Identify Patterns**: Which algorithms work better on which problems?

**Key Insight**: There's no single "best" algorithm - it depends on what you're trying to achieve!
