## 🚀 Your First Neural Network in 30 Seconds!

Let's start with pure magic - watch an artificial brain learn!

```ruby
require 'ai4r'

# Create your first neural brain! 🧠
# 2 inputs → 4 hidden neurons → 1 output
brain = Ai4r::NeuralNetwork::Backpropagation.new([2, 4, 1])
brain.init_network

puts "🎉 You just created an artificial brain with #{brain.structure.sum} neurons!"

# Let's see what it thinks before training
random_input = [0.5, 0.8]
untrained_output = brain.eval(random_input)
puts "🤔 Untrained brain says: #{untrained_output.first.round(3)}"
puts "   (This is just random - let's teach it something amazing!)"
```

**Mind = Blown Already!** 🤯 You just created a network with connections and weights, just like a tiny piece of a real brain!

## 🎪 The XOR Challenge: The Problem That Stumped Early AI

### 🧩 The "Impossible" Problem

In the 1960s, this simple problem nearly killed neural network research:

```ruby
# The XOR (eXclusive OR) truth table
# Input A | Input B | Output
#    0    |    0    |   0     ← Same inputs = 0
#    0    |    1    |   1     ← Different inputs = 1  
#    1    |    0    |   1     ← Different inputs = 1
#    1    |    1    |   0     ← Same inputs = 0
```

**Why was this "impossible"?** Try drawing a single line to separate the 1s from the 0s on a graph - you can't! This is what we call "not linearly separable."

### 🧠 Your Brain Will Solve It!

Watch your neural network conquer what stumped early AI researchers:

```ruby
require 'ai4r'

# Create the XOR-solving brain
xor_brain = Ai4r::NeuralNetwork::Backpropagation.new([2, 4, 1])
xor_brain.init_network
xor_brain.set_parameters(learning_rate: 0.5, momentum: 0.9)

# The "impossible" training data
xor_inputs = [
  [0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]
]
xor_outputs = [
  [0], [1], [1], [0]
]

puts "🎓 Teaching the brain XOR logic..."

# Watch the magic happen!
1000.times do |epoch|
  total_error = 0
  
  xor_inputs.each_with_index do |input, i|
    xor_brain.train(input, xor_outputs[i])
    
    # Calculate error for this pattern
    output = xor_brain.eval(input)
    error = (xor_outputs[i][0] - output[0]).abs
    total_error += error
  end
  
  # Show progress every 200 epochs
  if epoch % 200 == 0
    puts "Epoch #{epoch}: Average error = #{(total_error/4).round(4)}"
  end
end

puts "\n🎉 Training complete! Let's test our artificial genius:"

# Test the trained brain
xor_inputs.each_with_index do |input, i|
  output = xor_brain.eval(input)
  expected = xor_outputs[i][0]
  
  puts "#{input} → #{output[0].round(3)} (expected: #{expected})"
  
  # Check if it's close enough
  if (output[0] - expected).abs < 0.1
    puts "  ✅ CORRECT! The brain learned this pattern!"
  else
    puts "  ❌ Still learning..."
  end
end
```

**INCREDIBLE!** Your neural network just solved a problem that was considered impossible for single-layer networks! 🎉

## 🧠 How Does Your Artificial Brain Actually Work?

### 🏗️ Brain Architecture

Think of your neural network like this:

```
Input Layer    Hidden Layer    Output Layer
    [A] ────────── [●] ──────────── [Result]
     │   ╲       ╱   ╲           ╱
     │    ╲     ╱     ╲         ╱
     │     ╲   ╱       ╲       ╱
    [B] ────────── [●] ──────────┘
              ╲   ╱
               ╲ ╱
                [●]
                 │
                [●]
```

Each connection has a **weight** (strength) and each neuron has a **bias** (threshold).

### 🧮 The Magic Formula

Each neuron does this simple calculation:
1. **Multiply** each input by its connection weight
2. **Add** them all up, plus the bias
3. **Apply** an activation function (like sigmoid) to get the output

```ruby
# Peek inside a neuron's calculation
def neuron_calculation(inputs, weights, bias)
  # Step 1: Multiply inputs by weights
  weighted_sum = inputs.zip(weights).map { |input, weight| input * weight }.sum
  
  # Step 2: Add bias
  total = weighted_sum + bias
  
  # Step 3: Apply activation (sigmoid function)
  output = 1.0 / (1.0 + Math.exp(-total))
  
  puts "Inputs: #{inputs}"
  puts "Weights: #{weights.map { |w| w.round(3) }}"
  puts "Weighted sum: #{weighted_sum.round(3)}"
  puts "After bias: #{total.round(3)}"
  puts "Final output: #{output.round(3)}"
  
  output
end

# Example neuron calculation
result = neuron_calculation([0.5, 0.8], [0.7, -0.3], 0.1)
```

### 🎯 The Learning Secret: Backpropagation

When your network makes a mistake, it:
1. **Calculates** how wrong it was (error)
2. **Figures out** which weights caused the error (backward pass)
3. **Adjusts** those weights to reduce the error (gradient descent)
4. **Repeats** until it gets really good!

## 🎮 Hands-On Experiments

### 🔬 Experiment 1: Learning Rate Detective

What happens when you change how fast the brain learns?

```ruby
require 'ai4r'

# Test different learning rates
learning_rates = [0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0]

learning_rates.each do |rate|
  puts "\n🧪 Testing learning rate: #{rate}"
  
  # Create fresh brain for each test
  brain = Ai4r::NeuralNetwork::Backpropagation.new([2, 4, 1])
  brain.init_network
  brain.set_parameters(learning_rate: rate)
  
  # Train for 500 epochs
  500.times do
    xor_inputs.each_with_index do |input, i|
      brain.train(input, xor_outputs[i])
    end
  end
  
  # Test accuracy
  correct = 0
  xor_inputs.each_with_index do |input, i|
    output = brain.eval(input)
    correct += 1 if (output[0] - xor_outputs[i][0]).abs < 0.1
  end
  
  puts "   Accuracy: #{correct}/4 patterns correct"
  puts "   Rate #{rate}: #{'⭐' * correct}#{'☆' * (4-correct)}"
end
```

**What did you discover?** Too slow and it never learns. Too fast and it overshoots the target!

### 🔬 Experiment 2: Architecture Explorer

Does brain size matter? Let's find out!

```ruby
# Test different hidden layer sizes
architectures = [
  [2, 2, 1],   # Tiny brain
  [2, 4, 1],   # Small brain  
  [2, 8, 1],   # Medium brain
  [2, 16, 1],  # Big brain
  [2, 4, 4, 1] # Deep brain (2 hidden layers)
]

architectures.each do |structure|
  puts "\n🏗️  Testing architecture: #{structure}"
  puts "   Total neurons: #{structure.sum}"
  
  brain = Ai4r::NeuralNetwork::Backpropagation.new(structure)
  brain.init_network
  brain.set_parameters(learning_rate: 0.5)
  
  # Train and measure time
  start_time = Time.now
  
  1000.times do
    xor_inputs.each_with_index do |input, i|
      brain.train(input, xor_outputs[i])
    end
  end
  
  training_time = Time.now - start_time
  
  # Test final accuracy
  correct = 0
  xor_inputs.each_with_index do |input, i|
    output = brain.eval(input)
    correct += 1 if (output[0] - xor_outputs[i][0]).abs < 0.1
  end
  
  puts "   ⏱️  Training time: #{training_time.round(2)} seconds"
  puts "   🎯 Accuracy: #{correct}/4 (#{(correct/4.0*100).round}%)"
  puts "   💡 Efficiency: #{(correct/training_time).round(2)} accuracy/second"
end
```

**Amazing insights await!** You'll discover the trade-offs between size, speed, and accuracy!

## 🎨 Advanced Pattern Recognition

### 🔢 Number Pattern Detector

Let's build something more impressive - a network that recognizes number patterns!

```ruby
require 'ai4r'

# Create training data for number patterns
# Even numbers → 0, Odd numbers → 1
def create_number_patterns
  patterns = []
  targets = []
  
  # Generate patterns for numbers 0-15
  (0..15).each do |number|
    # Convert to binary (4 bits)
    binary = [
      (number & 8) == 8 ? 1 : 0,  # Bit 3
      (number & 4) == 4 ? 1 : 0,  # Bit 2  
      (number & 2) == 2 ? 1 : 0,  # Bit 1
      (number & 1) == 1 ? 1 : 0   # Bit 0
    ]
    
    patterns << binary
    targets << [number % 2]  # 0 for even, 1 for odd
    
    puts "Number #{number.to_s.rjust(2)}: #{binary} → #{number % 2} (#{number.even? ? 'even' : 'odd'})"
  end
  
  [patterns, targets]
end

# Create the pattern recognition brain
puts "🧠 Creating number pattern detector..."
pattern_brain = Ai4r::NeuralNetwork::Backpropagation.new([4, 6, 1])
pattern_brain.init_network
pattern_brain.set_parameters(learning_rate: 0.3, momentum: 0.7)

# Generate training data
patterns, targets = create_number_patterns

puts "\n🎓 Training the pattern detector..."

# Train the network
2000.times do |epoch|
  patterns.each_with_index do |pattern, i|
    pattern_brain.train(pattern, targets[i])
  end
  
  if epoch % 500 == 0
    puts "  Epoch #{epoch}: Still learning..."
  end
end

puts "\n🎯 Testing pattern recognition:"

# Test the network
correct_predictions = 0

patterns.each_with_index do |pattern, i|
  output = pattern_brain.eval(pattern)
  expected = targets[i][0]
  prediction = output[0] > 0.5 ? 1 : 0
  
  number = pattern[0]*8 + pattern[1]*4 + pattern[2]*2 + pattern[3]*1
  result = prediction == expected ? "✅" : "❌"
  
  puts "Number #{number.to_s.rjust(2)} #{pattern}: predicted #{prediction} (#{prediction == 1 ? 'odd' : 'even'}), actual #{expected} #{result}"
  
  correct_predictions += 1 if prediction == expected
end

accuracy = (correct_predictions / patterns.length.to_f * 100).round(1)
puts "\n🎉 Final accuracy: #{correct_predictions}/#{patterns.length} (#{accuracy}%)"

if accuracy > 90
  puts "🌟 INCREDIBLE! Your neural network is a pattern recognition genius!"
elsif accuracy > 70
  puts "👍 Great job! Your network learned the pattern pretty well!"
else
  puts "🤔 Hmm, might need more training or a different architecture!"
end
```

**Mind-blowing!** Your network just learned to detect mathematical patterns without being explicitly programmed for math!

## 🏆 Advanced Challenges

### 🎯 Challenge 1: Multi-Class Classification

Build a network that can distinguish between three different patterns:

```ruby
# Three-way classification: Small, Medium, Large numbers
def create_size_classification_data
  data = []
  targets = []
  
  50.times do
    # Random number between 0 and 100
    number = rand(101)
    
    # Normalize to [0,1]
    normalized = number / 100.0
    
    # Classify: 0-33 = small, 34-66 = medium, 67-100 = large
    if number <= 33
      target = [1, 0, 0]  # Small
      category = "small"
    elsif number <= 66
      target = [0, 1, 0]  # Medium  
      category = "medium"
    else
      target = [0, 0, 1]  # Large
      category = "large"
    end
    
    data << [normalized]
    targets << target
    
    puts "Number #{number.to_s.rjust(3)} (#{normalized.round(3)}) → #{category}"
  end
  
  [data, targets]
end

# Your challenge: Create and train this network!
puts "🎯 CHALLENGE: Build a 3-way classifier!"
puts "   Architecture suggestion: [1, 5, 3] (1 input, 5 hidden, 3 outputs)"
puts "   Success criteria: >80% accuracy"

# TODO: Implement your solution here!
```

### 🎯 Challenge 2: Sequence Predictor

Can your network learn to predict the next number in a sequence?

```ruby
# Sequence prediction: Given [A, B, C], predict D
sequences = [
  [[1, 2, 3], [4]],    # Counting up
  [[2, 4, 6], [8]],    # Even numbers
  [[1, 3, 5], [7]],    # Odd numbers
  [[1, 4, 7], [10]],   # +3 each time
  [[10, 8, 6], [4]]    # Counting down by 2
]

puts "🧠 CHALLENGE: Build a sequence predictor!"
puts "   Can your network learn mathematical patterns?"

# TODO: Your implementation here!
```

## 🔬 Understanding Different Network Types

### 🌀 Hopfield Networks: Associative Memory

Hopfield networks are like having a perfect memory that can recall complete patterns from partial cues:

```ruby
require 'ai4r'

# Create a Hopfield network for pattern storage
puts "🧠 Creating associative memory network..."

# Store simple 4-bit patterns
patterns = [
  [1, -1, 1, -1],   # Pattern A
  [-1, 1, -1, 1],   # Pattern B  
  [1, 1, -1, -1],   # Pattern C
]

hopfield = Ai4r::NeuralNetwork::Hopfield.new(4)
hopfield.train(patterns)

puts "📚 Stored #{patterns.length} patterns in memory!"

# Test pattern recall
puts "\n🔍 Testing pattern recall:"

patterns.each_with_index do |pattern, i|
  recalled = hopfield.eval(pattern)
  match = pattern == recalled ? "✅" : "❌"
  puts "Pattern #{('A'.ord + i).chr}: #{pattern} → #{recalled} #{match}"
end

# Test with noisy patterns
puts "\n🔍 Testing with corrupted patterns:"

noisy_patterns = [
  [1, -1, 1, 1],    # Pattern A with last bit flipped
  [-1, -1, -1, 1],  # Pattern B with second bit flipped
]

noisy_patterns.each_with_index do |noisy, i|
  recalled = hopfield.eval(noisy)
  puts "Noisy input: #{noisy}"
  puts "Recalled:    #{recalled}"
  
  # Check which stored pattern this matches
  patterns.each_with_index do |original, j|
    if original == recalled
      puts "✅ Successfully recalled pattern #{('A'.ord + j).chr}!"
    end
  end
  puts
end
```

**Amazing!** The network can fill in missing pieces, just like human memory!

### 🗺️ Self-Organizing Maps: Data Visualization

SOMs learn to organize data without being told what to look for:

```ruby
require 'ai4r'

# Create 2D data points forming rough clusters
data_points = []

# Cluster 1: Around (0, 0)
10.times { data_points << [rand * 2 - 1, rand * 2 - 1] }

# Cluster 2: Around (3, 3)  
10.times { data_points << [rand * 2 + 2, rand * 2 + 2] }

# Cluster 3: Around (0, 3)
10.times { data_points << [rand * 2 - 1, rand * 2 + 2] }

puts "🗺️  Creating self-organizing map..."
puts "Data points: #{data_points.length}"

# Create dataset
dataset = Ai4r::Data::DataSet.new(
  data_items: data_points,
  data_labels: ['x', 'y']
)

# Create and train SOM
som = Ai4r::Som::Som.new(5, 5, dataset)  # 5x5 grid
som.train(1000)

puts "🎯 SOM training complete!"
puts "The network organized your data into a 5x5 topological map!"

# Test where different points map to
test_points = [
  [0, 0],    # Should map near cluster 1
  [3, 3],    # Should map near cluster 2
  [0, 3],    # Should map near cluster 3
  [1.5, 1.5] # Should map somewhere in between
]

puts "\n🔍 Testing point mapping:"

test_points.each do |point|
  winner = som.find_winner(point)
  y = winner / 5
  x = winner % 5
  puts "Point #{point} maps to grid position (#{x}, #{y})"
end
```

**Incredible!** The SOM automatically discovered the structure in your data!
