# The Ultimate Search Algorithm Showdown: AI4R Benchmarking Guide 🔍

*"In the maze of possibilities, every search algorithm has its own compass. The art lies in knowing which direction leads to treasure."*

## What's This All About? 🎯

Welcome to the most exciting competition in AI education! The **SearchBench** is your personal arena for pitting different search algorithms against each other in epic battles of efficiency, speed, and intelligence. Think of it as the Olympics for AI search algorithms, but with more educational value and fewer performance-enhancing drugs.

## Quick Start: Your First Algorithm Battle 🥊

```ruby
require 'ai4r'

# Create your arena
bench = Ai4r::Experiment::SearchBench.new(verbose: true)

# Choose your fighters
bench.add_algorithm(:astar_manhattan, Ai4r::Search::AStar.new(heuristic: :manhattan))
bench.add_algorithm(:astar_euclidean, Ai4r::Search::AStar.new(heuristic: :euclidean))

# Set up the challenge
maze = [
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
  [1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]

bench.add_problem(:simple_maze, {
  type: :pathfinding,
  grid: maze,
  start: [0, 0],
  goal: [4, 4]
})

# Let the battle begin!
results = bench.run
bench.display_results(results)
```

The "best" algorithm depends on your specific requirements (speed vs. quality vs. memory).

### 4. Iterate and Learn
Use results to refine your understanding and improve algorithm selection.

### 5. Document Everything
Keep notes on your experiments for future reference and learning.

## Final Thoughts 🎯

The SearchBench isn't just about finding the fastest algorithm—it's about understanding the deep principles that govern search in artificial intelligence. Every benchmark run is a lesson in computational complexity, algorithmic design, and practical problem-solving.

Remember: In the world of AI search, there's no single "best" algorithm—only the best algorithm for your specific problem, constraints, and requirements. The SearchBench helps you discover these insights through hands-on experimentation.

Now go forth and search! 🚀
