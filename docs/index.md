# AI4R Documentation

AI4R provides a collection of machine learning algorithms implemented in Ruby. Algorithms include genetic algorithms, self-organizing maps, neural networks, automatic classifiers and clustering methods.

## Getting Started

Install the gem:

```bash
gem install ai4r
```

Include the library in your code:

```ruby
require 'ai4r'
```

## Practical Examples

* **Genetic Algorithms** – optimization of the Travelling Salesman Problem.
* **Neural Networks** – simple OCR recognition of visual patterns.
* [Hopfield Networks](hopfield_network.md) – memory based recognition of noisy patterns.
* [Hierarchical Clustering](hierarchical_clustering.md) – build dendrograms from merge steps.
* **Automatic Classifiers** – identify relevant marketing targets using decision trees.
* [Hyperpipes](hyperpipes.md) – baseline classifier using value ranges.
