## üöÄ Quick Example

Here's a taste of what you can do with AI4R:

```ruby
require 'ai4r'

# Train a neural network to solve XOR
network = Ai4r::NeuralNetwork::Backpropagation.new([2, 4, 1])
network.train([[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,1]], [0,1,1,0])

# Use genetic algorithm for traveling salesman
cities = [[0,0], [1,1], [2,0], [0,2]]
ga = Ai4r::GeneticAlgorithm::GeneticSearch.new(cities)
best_route = ga.run

# Classify data with decision trees
classifier = Ai4r::Classifiers::ID3.new
classifier.build(training_data)
prediction = classifier.eval(test_instance)
```
