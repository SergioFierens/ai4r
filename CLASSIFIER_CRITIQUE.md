# AI4R Classifier Algorithms Educational Critique

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive analysis of the classifier implementations in AI4R, this critique identifies significant educational gaps that limit learning and experimentation opportunities for AI students and teachers. While the library provides solid implementations of traditional algorithms (ID3, Naive Bayes, OneR, ZeroR, PRISM), it lacks modern classifier algorithms and comprehensive educational features necessary for effective AI education.

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Existing Classifier Algorithms

**Instance-Based Learning:**
- IB1 (lib/ai4r/classifiers/ib1.rb): Nearest neighbor implementation

**Simple Baselines:**
- OneR (lib/ai4r/classifiers/one_r.rb): Single-rule classifier
